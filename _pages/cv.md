University of Tennessee, Knoxville

**PI: Karen G. Lloyd, Ph.D.** 2014-2018

_The role of uncultured microbes in the Arctic marine sediment carbon cycle_

Performed high resolution molecular analyses of microbial abundance, population structure, and biological function by coupling next generation sequencing of metagenomes, transcriptomes, and metabolomes with geochemical data of the anoxic sediment environment of Svalbard (79°N) to discover that depositional environment is a strong control on the distribution of anaerobic respiration pathways.

_Evolutionary adaptations and metabolic pathways of methanogens in Antarctic Permafrost_

Reconstructed the first publicly available methanogen genome from Antarctic permafrost. I also performed protein structure modeling, phylogenetics, and pathway reconstruction to determine structural adaptations to its harsh, cold environment and found several pathways by which methane can be generated with future warming conditions.

_The deep biosphere in Baltic Sea Basin sediments_

Collected and compared quantitative PCR data and direct cell counts of the Baltic Sea deep subsurface biosphere in an interlaboratory meta-analysis that found CARD-FISH is severely limited in its utility in energy-starved, low biomass sediments.

**PI: Linda C. Kah, Ph.D.** 2012-2014

_Mineralized microbialites as archives of environmental evolution of a hypersaline lake basin: Laguna Negra, Catamarca Province, Argentina_

Performed geomicrobiological analyses on microbial carbonates from the High Andes, NW Argentina in collaboration with the University of Córdoba, Argentina and The National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET). This work coupled carbon and oxygen isotope analysis with mineralogical, organic matter, and petrographic observations to establish the utility of microbialites as faithful records of lake basin evolution.
