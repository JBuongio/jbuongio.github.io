  description: "Microbes living in Laguna Negra, a hypersaline lake standing at 4100 meters above sea level, have to deal with polyextreme conditions -- high salt content, low nutrients, severe aridity, and high UV radiation to name a few. These microbes also have to contend with supersaturation of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral that entombs them in rock. We call these rocks 'microbialites'."
