  description: "Microbes living in Laguna Negra, a hypersaline lake standing at 4100 meters above sea level, have to deal with polyextreme conditions -- high salt content, low nutrients, severe aridity, and high UV radiation to name a few. These microbes also have to contend with supersaturation of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral that entombs them in rock. We call these rocks 'microbialites'."

  description: "Expeditions to the high Arctic to investigate microbial communities and biogeochemical cycles of fjord sediments. The Arctic is experiencing warming 2 - 3 times greater than the rest of the planet. As the climate warms, glacial retreat and melting drive ecosystem feedbacks that we are only beginning to understand and predict."

    text: Fossils of vasucular plants can be found all over Svalbard. This is because 400 million years ago, it sat near the equator and had a much different climate than it does today. In fact, the lush, swampy forests that typify the ancient ecosystem of Svalbard is responsible for the large coal-mining boom in this area during the turn of the century.
