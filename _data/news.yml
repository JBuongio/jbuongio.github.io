  I learned about new techniques for biosignature detection, microbe-mineral interactions, and even the philosophy behind needing to place statistical constraints on detecting life. We should shift from asking, <b> is this life?</b>, to asking, <b>are the signatures we detect are within 3 standard deviations from our definition, given some priors within a Baysian framework</b>.<br>
