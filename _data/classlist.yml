  description: An overview of microbiology, with particular emphasis on the role of microbes in human health and disease. Core concepts of evolution, cell structure and function, metabolism, genetics, microbial systems, and the impact of microorganisms on humans will be covered, and competencies in the application of the process of science, and use of quantitative reasoning will be developed. After students master sterile technique and safe laboratory practices, the laboratory portion of the course will focus on the development of microscopy, culture, and bacterial identification techniques.

  description: This course evaluates life as a feature of Earth, tracing the planetary changes that allowed life to originate, evolve, and diversify. This course asks students to challenge their definition of life and reflect on readings of primary literature. The rise of multicellularity, taxonomic diversity, biochemistry, biogeography, and other biological and ecological concepts are placed within the framework of the Five Big Ideas of Biology.
